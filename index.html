    <p>They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon, and yes, it's intentional</p>
    <p>Year's ago our founder Pat was out on the Market asking people what they wanted on a crisp autumn day. At the market, Pat decided to test out a new idea and it was truly a hit. Everything you could need in salmon and a cookie, a salmon shaped cookie made of salmon.  </p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <img src="./img/family.jpg" alt="A family enjoying cookies">
    <p>We are a local farm to table business, why farm our salmon? It leads to healthier salmon and so that it doesn't hurt the wild native salmon population. Part of our proceeds goes towards salmon habitat restoration. You can see more about us and our efforts to promote preservation at Issaquah's very own <a href="http://www.issaquahchamber.com/salmondays">Salmon Days Festival</a>.</p>
    <p>At Salmon Cookies you are a member of our family. As we are a family owned and operated business we take pride in bringing the community together around a warm plate of salmon cookies.</p>
